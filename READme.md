My Resturant Diary!

# Why am I building this app? What is the problem I am solving for?
My  Resturant Diary is THEE platform for building your traveling itineraries, date nights, exploring fine cuisine and making new memories. A bit about me, I am a **HUGE FOODIE**. I love exploring new foods and I like to think of myself as a reformed picky eater.
I used to be afraid of trying new foods in fear that I would dislike them, but I had an epiphany-- the more foods I try, the more I can discover things that I actually do like! A couple of months ago I went to France with my familyl and my goodness, it was so hard to find somewhere to eat! Of course you have Google
Maps where you can explore different ressturants but with that kind of search, you deal with the paradox of choice. Not to mention, reviews can be misleading as everyone has different opinions and what may be good priced to one person, may be more expensive for another.

Especially in a foreign country, there are different cultural aspects wehn it comes to dining and I think the most notable one as an American, is the differing portion sizes in different cuisines. In my experience, this is an overlooked part that caught me and my family by suprise when a local reccomended us a place only 
to be met with interesting portion sizes. 

I had the idea of building a platform that could make finding places to eat more straightforward and it can be from reviews that you trust. Word of mouth is one of the most effective marketing strategies there is and its why this platform differes from others. You can be reccomended places by people you personally know, which makes
the experience much more promising.

### Problem Statement(6/25) How might I make the experiecne of finding a resturant in a foreign place more straightfroward, non-misleading and satiating for resturant goers?

## My Resturant Diary is a web application that allows users to find resturants based on their locations and find eateries visited by their friends. Users can share pictures, add commentary about the places, and get accurate reccomendations based on their personals interests/diet restrictions and pricing with the integration of AI.
